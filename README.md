# Conversix

Conversix is a web application allowing users to scrape LinkedIn Sales Navigator for job candidates. The user is able to filter their search and retrieve a list of candidates up to their daily allowance.

Data is then available in a list where it can be downloaded / merged and downloaded

Admins are able to add Clients (company) and then create Users of the Client where they are able to login.

This is the first part of the project. Fuze IQ have lots of plans for this system.
